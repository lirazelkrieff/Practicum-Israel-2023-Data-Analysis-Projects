# How To Tell a Story Using Data
My partners and I have decided to open a small robot-run cafe in Los Angeles. The project is promising but expensive, so we decide to try to attract investors. The investors are interested in the current market conditions — will we be able to maintain your success when the novelty of robot waiters wears off? It's time to prepare some market research.

We've been provided with open-source data on restaurants in LA, so all conclusions and recommendations are based on this data only.

Description of the data

rest_data table:

- object_name — establishment name
- chain — chain establishment (TRUE/FALSE)
- object_type — establishment type
- address — address
- number — number of seats
