# What makes a game successful?
This is a project for the online store Ice, which sells video games all over the world. User and expert reviews, genres, platforms (e.g. Xbox or PlayStation), and historical data on game sales are available from open sources. The marketing team wishes to identify patterns that determine whether a game succeeds or not. That will allow them to spot potential big winners and plan advertising campaigns. The dataset contains the abbreviation ESRB - The Entertainment Software Rating Board evaluates a game's content and assigns an age rating such as Teen or Mature.
