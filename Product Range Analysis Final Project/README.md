# Product Range Analysis Project

The objective of this project is to gain insights into the performance and composition of an online store's product range. By analyzing various aspects such as revenue, popularity, returns, and customer preferences, the project aims to provide valuable information for making data-driven decisions to optimize the product assortment and enhance overall business performance.

The store has been operating for a specific period, collecting data on customer purchases, product descriptions, revenue, and other relevant metrics. To better understand the dynamics of the product range, this analysis project was initiated. The analysis focuses on several key aspects of the product range, including revenue trends, seasonal patterns, category performance, popularity of specific products, and the relationship between unit prices and quantities purchased. By examining these factors, the project aims to provide actionable insights to optimize the product range, improve customer satisfaction, and drive business growth.
